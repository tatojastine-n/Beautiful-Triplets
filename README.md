# Beautiful-Triplets
This C# program counts the number of "beautiful triplets" in an array. The `beautifulTriplets` function iterates through each element, checks if the element plus `d` and element plus `2*d` exist in the array, and increments a count for each valid triplet. The `Main` method reads the array and `d` from input, calls the function, and outputs the total count.
